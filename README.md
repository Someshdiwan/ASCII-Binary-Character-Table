# ASCII & Unicode Character Table

## 📜 What is ASCII?
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that represents text in computers and electronic devices. It consists of **128 characters**, including:
- English letters (A-Z, a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
- Control characters (e.g., newline, tab)

## 🌍 What is Unicode?
Unicode is a **universal character encoding system** designed to support all writing systems in the world. Unlike ASCII (which is limited to 128 or 256 characters), Unicode provides over **143,000 characters**, covering:
- Letters from multiple languages
- Mathematical symbols
- Emojis 😊
- Special scripts (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, Devanagari)
